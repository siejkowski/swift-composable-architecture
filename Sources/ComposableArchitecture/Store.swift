  ///     struct LoginView: View {
  ///       let store: Store<LoginState, LoginAction>
  ///
  ///       var body: some View { ... }
  ///     }
  ///
  /// If its body were to use a view store of the same domain, this would introduce a number of
  /// problems:
  ///
  /// * The login view would be able to read from `twoFactorAuth` state. This state is only intended
  ///   to be read from the two-factor auth screen.
  ///
  /// * Even worse, changes to `twoFactorAuth` state would now cause SwiftUI to recompute
  ///   `LoginView`'s body unnecessarily.
  ///
  /// * The login view would be able to send `twoFactorAuth` actions. These actions are only
  ///   intended to be sent from the two-factor auth screen (and reducer).
  ///
  /// * The login view would be able to send non user-facing login actions, like `loginResponse`.
  ///   These actions are only intended to be used in the login reducer to feed the results of
  ///   effects back into the store.
  ///
  /// To avoid these issues, one can introduce a view-specific domain that slices off the subset of
  /// state and actions that a view cares about:
  ///
  ///     extension LoginView {
  ///       struct State: Equatable {
  ///         var email: String
  ///         var password: String

  ///         case loginButtonTapped
  ///         case passwordChanged(String)
  ///       }
  ///     }
  ///
  /// One can also introduce a couple helpers that transform feature state into view state and
  /// transform view actions into feature actions.
  ///
  ///     extension LoginState {
  ///       var view: LoginView.State {
  ///         .init(email: self.email, password: self.password)
